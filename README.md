# Fantastic Widgets - Privacy Policy

## Thank you for showing interest in Fantastic Widgets. 

We take the security and privacy of our users very seriously and this will always be our top priority. 
Fantastic Widgets was created to let you customize your iPhone home screen to your heart's content, at the same time provide an intuitive and simple experience. 

Another priority of ours is to ensure that your data is kept securely, and only on your device. Your data never leaves your phone.

The following Privacy Policy explains how Fantastic Widgets stores your data, and all of the measures we take to secure it.

We take limited data that is necessary for your widgets to function. We take the location information to show you weather in the widgets.
For Custom Youtuber shortcuts, we ask for the image that should be shown on the widget.

We do not and will never share, upload, or have access to this information. It strictly stays on your device, and is only accessible to you. 
When it comes to images, Fantastic Widgets only saves the image you pick, which will never be shared with anyone other than yourself.
These images never leave your device.

We do not take any other information and no information is transmitted to our servers.
